# I'm going to build an Api-Rest with NodeJs & Mysql, but i am going to use querys to the endpoint not ORM.

install

`` npm install --save mysql `` 

Let’s start off by installing a the nodemon package. This is a tool that automatically restarts a Node application when file changes in a directory are detected:

`` npm install --save-dev nodemon `` 

USE EXPRESS TO HAVE SERVER 
``npm install --save express``

to run app with nodemoon

``npm run dev ``


wE HAVE TWO WAYS to play with querys

One create const with query
Two create the query into the function

Also we can create the constant to call it after query. For tha y use ? ternary is a well practice
