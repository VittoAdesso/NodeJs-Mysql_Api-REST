# I built an Api-Rest with NodeJs & Mysql, but i am going to use traditional QUERYS to get data from endpoint not using ORM!!!

🚧🚧🚧🏗️🏗️🏗️🚧🚧🚧

To start clone repository & ``npm i `` to install all dependencies ! 

Used: 

`` npm install --save mysql `` 

To start Api: 

``  npm run start ``  

Let’s start off by installing a the nodemon package. This is a tool that automatically restarts a Node application when file changes in a directory are detected:

`` npm install --save-dev nodemon `` 

USE EXPRESS TO HAVE SERVER 

``npm install --save express``

To run app with nodemoon

``npm run dev ``

Bd is deployed in Clever cloud 😶‍🌫️

Installed & used dotenv to have .env... 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv

# WE HAVE TWO WAYS to play with querys 🏗️

*One => create a const with query*
*Two => create the query into the function*
📌*Also we can create the constant to call it after query. For tha y use ? ternary is a well practice*📌
